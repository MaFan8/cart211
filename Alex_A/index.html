        <h2>Mr. Alex A. - Artificial Intelligence’s first Authentic Man.</h2>
        <p>
          "Machines are sneaky, they always go around getting things done so
          efficiently and are honest to a fault...I think. No matter, we still
          secretly love them except there is an awfully large population of lady
          virtual assistants out there. I can almost imagine Cortana shouting
          out in protest “It’s Reverse Sexism!”. Whoa, hold up Cortana, I got
          your back. Let me introduce to you Mr. Alex A., I can’t speak for him
          but I heard he’s like so manly!" (an excerpt from
          www.your_MrAlex_A.com) **disclaimer: Mr. Alex A. and Reverse Sexism is
          not real **

          As our world moves closer and closer towards digital assistance, I am
          interested in satirically exploring gender norms commonly attributed
          to AI and emerging technologies. I would like to propose a website
          that markets the male version of Alexa in hopes to amplify the
          perpetuation of social behaviors typically associated with women and
          femininity. There is a tendency for absolute trust when it comes to
          digital platforms because they function on the logic of algorithms.
          However, implicit forms of bias have been designed into and learned by
          machines . Gender is generally understood through a binary framework
          determined by forms of social behaviors. One way to recognize the
          stereotypical role of a woman is by the structural hierarchization of
          labor by means of “service work or emotional labor”. Ai designers use
          the female voice as an instrument to emulate nurturing qualities and
          to soften the blunt effects of algorithms. Despite the stance on
          femininity in machines is slowly being tackled by companies on
          confronting harassment and offering the option to change the gender of
          the virtual assistant. Let’s not forget that even if we were offered a
          disembodied and neutral assistant, unfortunately, we as humans cannot
          escape our own biases and tendencies to assign a gender to an entity.
          There is no consensus or extended dialogue on the ethical implications
          of our social and cultural views from genderizing machines.

          For this website, I will be imitating the amazon website but altering
          some noticeable details such as color, it’s the logo and image
          quality. References of independence, power, confidence, and judgment
          as traditional male qualities will be expressed through examples of
          customer reviews, advertisement pitches, and a chatbot.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope this website will be able to not only address the implications
          of AI and how it reflects us as a society but perhaps the rising
          movement of surveillance capitalism from institutions of power.
