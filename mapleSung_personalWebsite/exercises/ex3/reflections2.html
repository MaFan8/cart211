    <h2>Daniel Joseph, The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought the US Would Mess It Up</h2>
    <p>
      I was not aware that Canada was wary and cautious about net neutrality in the 70s and did try to create their own national system. It proposes that instead of having foreign and private companies have more control over our data, it would be better to have the government manage it. Though it seems that this author is hinting that many open source programs tend to be commoditized eventually. He does suggest that there are  community initiatives on mesh networks and I do believe if this stays as a community owned project, it will be very hard to commoditize. Then again, to climb down the rabbit hole, complete inclusivity is very hard to achieve when these projects are just limited to certain communities that do decide to take the initiative. When and where does it end where the internet is truly free from even the community? I’m not sure that’s a bad thing but just an idea.
