    <h2>Vannevar Bush, "As We May Think," Atlantic Monthly</h2>
    <p>
      Considering the date in which this article was published, Bush has a surprisingly accurate solution and vision of technology today. Even going as far as calling out the obstacles that technology still faces. I’ve found that there are add-ons for my web browser that allow me to search by images which is amazing!  However, this pandemic has proven while technology is a great form of connectivity, it lacks what the human touch can provide when we are all in isolation.  Bush is a well informed author but a little hard to comprehend since most of their important points are densely written coupled with examples of technology that I don’t have any experience with. I’m still confused by what they mean by how people will lose the experience of process and the ambiguity of the outcome. I’d be interested in what Bush has to say if they knew that we have arrived at artificial intelligence.
