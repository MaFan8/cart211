    <h2>Nine Eyes of Google Street View (Jon Rafman, 2008 - ongoing)</h2>
    <p>
      After reflecting on F.A.T. lab’s work on trying to expose Google as the great monopoly of the web, I immediately thought about Jon Rafman’s work called “Nine Eyes on Google Street View”. This work is aimed to repurpose the Google Street View in
      attempt to question photography and the human interference when it comes to documentation. The photos presented are raw and showcase glimpse of lives lived all around us. I have these conflicted feelings of gratitude to be a witness and on the
      other hand, sadness for the loss of a private moment in these people’s lives. This all leads me to question Rafman’s process of displaying these photos, when he takes these photos from Google and exhibits them, is he also like a photographer in
      how he/she controls the content? Is this just another level of intervention when these photos are taken out of Google’s assumed purpose of just taking photos out of necessity to map the world.
