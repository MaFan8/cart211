  <h2>Vannevar Bush, "As We May Think," Atlantic Monthly</h2>
  <p>
    Considering the date in which this article was published, Bush has a
    surprisingly accurate solution and vision of technology today. Even going
    as far as calling out the obstacles that technology still faces. I’ve
    found that there are add-ons for my web browser that allows me to search
    by images which is amazing! However, this pandemic has proven while
    technology is a great form of connectivity, it lacks what the human touch
    can provide when we are all in isolation. Bush is a well informed author
    but a little hard to comprehend since most of their important points are
    densely written coupled with examples of technology that I don’t have any
    experience with. I’m still confused by what they mean by how people will
    lose the experience of process and the ambiguity of the outcome. I’d be
    interested in what Bush has to say if they knew that we have arrived at
    artificial intelligence.

  <h2>Daniel Joseph, The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought the US Would Mess It Up</h2>
  <p>
    I was not aware that Canada was wary and cautious about net neutrality in the 70s and did try to create their own national system. It proposes that instead of having foreign and private companies have most control over our data, it would be better to have the government manage it. Though it seems that this author is hinting that many open source programs tend to be commoditized eventually. He does suggest that there are  community initiatives on mesh networks and I do believe if this stays as a community owned project, it will be very hard to commoditize. Then again, to climb down the rabbit hole, complete inclusivity is very hard to achieve when these projects are just limited to certain communities that do decide to take the initiative. When and where does it end where the internet is truly free from even the community? I’m not sure that’s a bad thing but just an idea.
