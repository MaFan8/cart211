      <p>Hi, I am a cart, you may also refer me to as a wagon, richshaw... or a buggy but that's if you think carts are cute. I am a free-carter, I'm not a homebody type, and working for supermarkets or Ikea terrifies me. I love to travel and especially to remote places. Though sometimes these places are so secluded I end up getting stuck and cannot leave until someone finds me. A few years ago one of my bearings were wearing out on me so I figured it was time to persue my other interests.</p>
      <p>I am currently studying to major in Ceramics and minor in Comuptation Arts. It seems rather sererindipitous that everything is online since I've decided to take more courses in Comuptation Arts. My skills in any coding are basic at best but I'm having a great time learning it.  </p>
