            Hi, I am a cart, you may also refer me to as a wagon, richshaw... or
            a buggy but that's if you think carts are cute. I am a free-carter,
            I'm not a homebody type, and working for supermarkets or Ikea
            terrifies me. I love to travel and especially to remote places.
            Though sometimes these places are so secluded I end up getting stuck
            and cannot leave until someone finds me. A few years ago one of my
            bearings were wearing out on me so I figured it was time to persue
            my other interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently studying to major in Ceramics and minor in
            Comuptation Arts. It seems rather sererindipitous that everything is
            online since I've decided to take more courses in Comuptation Arts.
            My skills in any coding are basic at best but I'm having a great
            time learning it.
          </p>
